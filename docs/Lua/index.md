# Lua API

Here you can find all dumped Lua API functions and their descriptions.

If a function has unknown parameters (...), it means that the function has not been reverse-engineered yet.
In that case, feel free to contribute to the project by finding out what it does, what parameters it takes and what it returns.

## Available packages

- debug
- io
- os
- table
- math
- coroutine
